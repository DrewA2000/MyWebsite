        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm<strong> Drew Anastasio</strong>, a senior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University.</a>.
            When it comes to accessibly in computing, I believe this is a topic that is not talked about enough, and
            I took this class in order to learn more about it. I had no idea that accessibly in computing had come as
            far as it has. Something that I am super interested in is screen readers. I recently watched a video on a
            blind person using the computer through screen readers and it was something I never even could have imagined.
            Before this class I just thought blind people couldn't use computers.
